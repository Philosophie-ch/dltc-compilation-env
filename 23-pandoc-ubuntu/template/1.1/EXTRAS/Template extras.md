Template extras
===============

This folder contains files that are not part of the template:
the production of an article from a source doesn't need them.

Contents
--------

1. Files needed to copyedit an article: `master.md` and `Makefile` (Linux/MacOs)
	or `master-win.md` and `make.bat` (Windows).
2. Files needed to copyedit an entire issue.
3. Other files used to create or design components of the template.
